This snippet includes:
- the [release](/product/releases/) of your application, using `process.env.npm_package_version`, which both enables [source maps](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/) as well as tracking of regressions and suspect commits.
- our [performance monitoring](/product/performance/) package.

```javascript {tabTitle: ESM}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version, // To set your release version
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Remember to lower this in production
});
```
